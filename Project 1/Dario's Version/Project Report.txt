Try your program with the command line parameter set to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Analyze and explain
the results. Put your explanation in your project report.

Project Report

With a command line parameter set to 1, the program runs as expected,
because there is never more than one thread modifying the shared variable.
With more than 1 thread accessing the same variable at the same time,
some increments are lost, because first one thread reads the value, then
another reads and increments, and then the first sets it to 1 more than
it read, effectively invalidating the other thread's increment.
